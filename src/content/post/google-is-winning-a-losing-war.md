Google went from "disrupted by ChatGPT" to taking real market share. Gemini grew from 5% to 20% of AI traffic in a year. ChatGPT dropped from 87% to 65%.

They're winning. But winning what?

Search is one of the best businesses ever created. A query costs a penny to serve and makes 1.6 cents at 35% margins. AI queries cost 3-6x more. Even if revenue holds, margins don't.

Worse: AI answers reduce the need to search. Click-through rates drop 35% when AI Overviews appear. Gartner thinks organic search traffic falls 50% by 2028.

Margin compression *and* volume compression. A double hit.

The bull case is that inference costs are falling 10x per year. The bear case is that frontier models aren't getting cheaper nearly as fast — and Google trades at 33x earnings after a 75% run.

Google is winning the AI war. The question is whether the prize is worth less than what they're defending.
