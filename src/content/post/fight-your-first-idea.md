Most bad thinking doesn't come from a lack of intelligence. It comes from rushed reasoning.

Someone disagrees, a plan falters, or a metric drops. It feels like a threat. The mind reaches for the nearest explanation that restores comfort. That explanation might sound smart—sometimes it's even correct—but that's not why we settle on it. We do it because we close the loop early.

That becomes a dangerous habit: accepting whatever explanation protects our identity. We incorporate these thoughts and stories into our sense of self.

When a belief becomes "me," evidence starts to feel like a personal attack. And when we feel attacked, we do what humans do: we get defensive. We explain without listening. We refute instead of understand. That's the mind rushing to feel safe.

This urgency trumps clarity. The search for comfort replaces curiosity. And no matter how smart you are, that pattern will make your thinking worse.

It's not a brain issue. It's a habit issue.

The antidote is to fight your first idea. Default to treating your thoughts and beliefs as hypotheses. Then challenge them with one credible alternative. Steelman the rival explanation to the one you instinctively reached for. If you can't produce a plausible alternative, you're probably not thinking—you're defending.

Ask the most important question: **What would change my mind?**

If you can't answer it, you're mixing values with factual claims, and every disagreement becomes personal. Values don't need evidence. Claims do.

Claims can be checked, so write them down. Write your beliefs and ideas as testable claims. Revisit them. Recalibrate. Do not rely on memory alone. It will trick you into thinking you were right all along. It will protect you from learning anything new.

True thinking is writing down what you expect next, then letting reality grade you. Track your predictions. Review them when evidence arrives.

That's how you learn. That's how you think better.
