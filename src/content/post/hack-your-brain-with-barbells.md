Your brain is mounted on a skeleton. That skeleton has opinions.

You can optimize productivity all you want. But when your neck, back, or shoulders start complaining, your output drops to zero and your hobby becomes googling physical therapists.

To hack your brain, you have to maintain the body that runs it.

## Ergonomics is a bandaid

Changing your desk setup feels productive. Sometimes it helps. But it rarely fixes the real problem: you're weak and you sit too much.

The best posture is your next posture. Variation matters more than the perfect chair.

## What lifting actually does

It won't upgrade your IQ. But it improves the conditions your brain runs on:

- **Sleep**: resistance training improves sleep quality. Better sleep is the most boring and effective brain hack.
- **Mood**: exercise reduces depressive symptoms. Lifting included.
- **Pain**: strength training is one of the few things that consistently helps desk-body pain long term.
- **Longevity**: people who lift live longer than people who don't.

The theme: strength training reduces friction. Your brain can do its job when your body isn't fighting you.

## The program

Five movements. Twice a week. Repeat forever.

**Session A**
- Back Squat
- Overhead Press
- Pull-ups
- Bulgarian Split Squat
- Farmer Carries

**Session B**
- Deadlift
- Overhead Press
- Pull-ups
- Farmer Carries

Leave 2 reps in the tank. Add weight when you complete all reps with good form. That's it.

## Why this works

Compounds train everything in minimal time. Pull-ups build the back you need after hunching over a keyboard. Farmer carries make you hard to break.

Boring is effective. Simple is sustainable.

The goal isn't to become a powerlifter. It's to not feel fragile.
