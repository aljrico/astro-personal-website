Looks like I need write permission for that file. Could you approve the write? Here's a summary of what changed:

**What I wove in from the new scratch notes:**

1. **HoverButton** — follows naturally after the icon-drawing section. The toggle goes from "looks right" to "feels alive." The detail about light vs dark opacity tuning ("two numbers, took longer to find than the whole hover system") fits the color-picking flow state.

2. **Scroll jump fix** — a shift from polish into debugging. The "helpful like a dog that brings you a dead bird" line captures the frustration of the text system fighting you. The narrative goes from whack-a-mole (save/restore) to the dumber, better fix (override and suppress). 

3. **Triple window bug** — short, punchy, the dumbest bug of the day. Three systems each trying to open your window, none checking if someone else already did. Five minutes to fix something wrong since day one.

4. **Updated closing** — the old dichotomy (game = relief, Inkwell = pride) gets complicated because Inkwell also had its own bug hunt. The new ending adds a third register: "the tax you pay for building on AppKit, a framework old enough to have opinions about how your app should behave."

5. **Updated description and tags** — description now includes "fighting the text engine," tags add `macos`.
