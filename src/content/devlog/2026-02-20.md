The afternoon started with leftovers. The ore-halving penalty was living inside HollowsManager, reaching directly into ExpeditionManager's inventory like a roommate eating your food from the fridge. Pulled it out, gave it a proper home. Small thing. The kind of cleanup you do while the coffee's still warm and you haven't decided what today is really about yet.

Then the real work. The offline production AB test needed a redesign — not a tweak, a rethink. The old version was testing "free vs. not free." The new one asks a different question entirely: what happens when you stop selling the *absence* of friction and start selling the *presence* of something good?

"NO ADS" becomes "CLAIM ALWAYS."

Same feature. Completely different frame. One says "we'll stop annoying you." The other says "you deserve this every time." It's the kind of insight that feels obvious the second you hear it and invisible the second before. Stripped out the 2x multiplier option, killed the 1x collect link fallback, and landed on a single ad-gated button with a NoAds upsell card underneath. Cleaner. More honest about what the transaction actually is.

Centralized the claim logic while I was in there. Two paths — ad or NoAds purchase — funneling through the same flow. The kind of refactor that pays for itself the first time you need to change the behavior.

Caught myself with the debug force set to `.treatment` right before committing. Second time today. There's a pattern forming — I hack the AB group to test, then almost ship the hack. Need a better system for this. Or just more paranoia at commit time. Paranoia's cheaper.

Then a bug surfaced that had been there all along, hiding in plain sight. The claim button in the offline overlay? If the rewarded ad wasn't loaded yet, it did absolutely nothing. No feedback. No disabled state. Just a button that swallows your tap and gives you silence. The kind of bug that makes users think the app is broken and you think everything's fine because you always test with ads pre-loaded.

Fixed it in both the control and treatment views — because of course the control had the same latent bug. It just never mattered as much when there was a fallback collect link sitting right below it. Remove the fallback and suddenly the invisible becomes visible. Bugs don't appear. They get revealed.

Ended the day doing color work on the Inkwell theme. This is the good stuff — the part where you're not solving problems, you're *feeling* your way to the right answer. Swapped the light accent from that generic red to something deeper, cooler. The dark background got a touch of warmth. Replaced the amber highlight with a minty green that shouldn't work but does.

Picking hex values by hand. Squinting at the screen. Nudging a channel by 10 points, seeing if it breathes differently. This is where flow lives for me — not in the architecture, not in the logic. In the moment the color clicks and the whole theme shifts from "fine" to "mine."

Four commits. A refactor, a redesign, two bug fixes, and a palette that finally feels right. The kind of day where nothing is dramatic but everything moves forward. Tomorrow I'll look at the AB test data pipeline and make sure the new groups are tracking properly. Or I won't, and I'll spend the morning on something completely different. Both are equally likely and I've made peace with that.
