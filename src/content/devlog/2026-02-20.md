Started the day drawing icons. Not downloading them — drawing them. Bezier paths, stroke caps, coordinate math. A sun made of a hollow circle and eight ray lines. A moon made of two overlapping circles where the smaller one erases into a crescent. Both in a 24x24 coordinate space, scaled to 16pt templates. The kind of work that has no business being this satisfying.

This is the Inkwell stuff. The editor. The side project that keeps pulling me in when I should be doing other things. But today it was just... colors. Picking hex values by hand, tuning a theme palette one shade at a time. Deeper red. Warmer dark background. Swapping amber highlights for a minty green. The kind of decisions where you toggle back and forth fifty times and the difference is invisible to anyone but you. And it matters anyway.

That's where the morning went. And some of the afternoon.

Then I switched to the cookie clicker. The transition is always a little jarring — going from artisanal pixel-fussing to a codebase with thirty singleton managers and an AB testing framework. But there was real work to do.

The first thing was small. Ore penalty logic was living inside HollowsManager but mutating ExpeditionManager's inventory directly — one of those cross-boundary reaches that makes you twitch every time you see it. Extracted it into a proper method. Five minutes. Should've done it weeks ago.

The real session was the offline production redesign. We had an AB test called `freeOfflineProduction` — control vs free. Binary. Boring. Replaced it with `offlineProductionDesign_v1`, which is a better question. The treatment strips out the 2x multiplier button and the free collect link entirely. One button: CLAIM NOW (ad-gated). And next to it, a card that says CLAIM ALWAYS.

Not "NO ADS". CLAIM ALWAYS.

That reframe is the whole insight. "No Ads" sells avoidance — you're paying to escape friction. "Claim Always" sells aspiration — you're paying for permanent access to something good. Same IAP, completely different pitch. The psychology of it is so clean it almost feels obvious in hindsight. Which is usually how the good ideas feel.

Centralized the claim logic so both paths — ad and NoAds — flow through the same methods. Caught myself twice leaving debug force flags in the code. Treatment forced on, AB group hardcoded. The kind of thing that would ship a fundamentally broken test to production. Reverted both before committing. That discipline doesn't come naturally. It comes from having shipped broken AB tests before.

Then an external eye caught something I'd missed. The claim button was a silent no-op when the rewarded ad wasn't loaded yet. Tap it, nothing happens, no feedback. The button just... sits there, looking tappable and doing nothing. It existed before the redesign but the old treatment had a fallback collect link that masked it. Remove the fallback and suddenly the bug is front and center.

Disabled the button until the ad loads. NoAds users always enabled — they don't need the ad anyway. Applied the fix in both control and treatment because the control had the same latent bug. The kind of fix that takes ten minutes and makes you wonder how many other silent no-ops are hiding in the codebase, waiting for the right conditions to surface.

Two projects in one day. One where I'm hand-drawing crescent moons in coordinate space. One where I'm reframing monetization psychology. They shouldn't fit in the same brain but somehow they do.
