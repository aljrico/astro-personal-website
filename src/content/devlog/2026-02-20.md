The afternoon started with leftovers. The ore-halving penalty was living inside HollowsManager, reaching directly into ExpeditionManager's inventory like a roommate eating your food from the fridge. Pulled it out, gave it a proper home. Small thing. The kind of cleanup you do while the coffee's still warm and you haven't decided what today is really about yet.

Then the real work. The offline production AB test needed a redesign — not a tweak, a rethink. The old version was testing "free vs. not free." The new one asks a different question entirely: what happens when you stop selling the *absence* of friction and start selling the *presence* of something good?

"NO ADS" becomes "CLAIM ALWAYS."

Same feature. Completely different frame. One says "we'll stop annoying you." The other says "you deserve this every time." It's the kind of insight that feels obvious the second you hear it and invisible the second before. Stripped out the 2x multiplier option, killed the 1x collect link fallback, and landed on a single ad-gated button with a NoAds upsell card underneath. Cleaner. More honest about what the transaction actually is.

Centralized the claim logic while I was in there. Two paths — ad or NoAds purchase — funneling through the same flow. The kind of refactor that pays for itself the first time you need to change the behavior.

Caught myself with the debug force set to `.treatment` right before committing. There's a pattern forming — I hack the AB group to test, then almost ship the hack. Need a better system for this. Or just more paranoia at commit time. Paranoia's cheaper.

Then a bug surfaced that had been there all along, hiding in plain sight. The claim button in the offline overlay? If the rewarded ad wasn't loaded yet, it did absolutely nothing. No feedback. No disabled state. Just a button that swallows your tap and gives you silence. The kind of bug that makes users think the app is broken and you think everything's fine because you always test with ads pre-loaded.

Fixed it in both the control and treatment views — because of course the control had the same latent bug. It just never mattered as much when there was a fallback collect link sitting right below it. Remove the fallback and suddenly the invisible becomes visible. Bugs don't appear. They get revealed.

Switched to Inkwell. Color work first — the part where you're not solving problems, you're *feeling* your way to the right answer. The light-mode accent was too warm, too generic. Shifted it from `#D7494C` to `#CB2A42`. Deeper, cooler red. The dark-mode background went from `#1C1C1E` to `#1D1F20` — barely perceptible but warmer. And the dark-mode highlight swapped from amber at 40% to `#2ABD88` at 50%. Minty green instead of muddy yellow. Shouldn't work. Does.

Picking hex values by hand. Squinting at the screen. Nudging a channel by 10 points, seeing if it breathes differently. This is where flow lives — not in the architecture, not in the logic. In the moment the color clicks and the whole theme shifts from "fine" to "mine."

Then the fun one. I'd added a sun/moon toggle in the titlebar for switching light/dark mode. Started with SF Symbols — `sun.max` and `moon` — and they worked. But I wanted Lucide icons. Lucide doesn't ship macOS assets. So I drew them.

The sun is a stroked circle with eight ray lines, all plotted from Lucide's exact SVG coordinates in a 24x24 viewport, scaled down to 16 points. Round line caps on the rays. The moon is a filled crescent — two overlapping circles with compositing. Fill the outer circle, then `.clear` the inner one to carve out the bite. The inner circle's center and radius come straight from the SVG geometry: center at (16.5, 7.5), radius 9/sqrt(2). Both images set to template mode so the system handles tinting.

There's something satisfying about drawing icons with math instead of importing assets. No PNG to manage, no @2x variants, no asset catalog. Just coordinates and bezier paths. Seven lines of geometry each and they render pixel-perfect at any scale. Takes longer than dragging an SVG into Xcode but feels better every time you look at it.

Then I fell into the blog.

JetBrains Mono everywhere was starting to feel wrong. Monospace for body text — fine when the whole site had that terminal aesthetic. But the posts aren't code. They're essays. The font was fighting the content.

So I went font shopping. Started with Nunito Sans for everything. Looked bloody awful — too round, too soft, like the site had put on a cardigan. Reverted immediately. Then the real rabbit hole: what if only the headers need fixing? Monospace headers at display sizes look clunky. The characters are all the same width and the eye notices.

Tried Space Grotesk. Then Lora. Then Canela Deck, which is gorgeous but commercial. Fraunces — interesting, quirky, not quite right. Petrona — warm but no drama. Tiempos Text Bold — and there it was. High contrast, sharp serifs, the kind of font that makes a heading look like it means business.

For the body I landed on Styrene B. Another commercial font I'm demoing. It's a sans-serif with just enough personality to not feel generic, just enough restraint to not compete with the headings. Regular for body, Bold for emphasis. JetBrains Mono stays, but only for code.

Three fonts, three jobs. Tiempos for the things you read first. Styrene for everything you read next. JetBrains for the things you copy-paste.

Then the inline code needed work. Those gray pills with monospace inside proportional text — always a tension. Shrunk the font, added an accent-tinted background, killed the backtick quotes the typography plugin was adding. Moved the long formulas in the roguelite post out of inline and into proper fenced blocks. Links got a permanent underline — dimmed at 20% opacity, full accent on hover. Subtle enough to not clutter but clear enough to say "this goes somewhere."

Fonts are just colors for text.

And then, because the blog was open and I was already in the weeds, I looked under the hood. The robots.txt was still pointing to the template author's domain. Since launch. Every search engine that checked the sitemap URL got a 404. Hostia. Fixed that, added explicit directives for AI crawlers — GPTBot, PerplexityBot, the lot. If AI search is going to cite sources instead of ranking pages, might as well make sure the door is open.

Added JSON-LD structured data to every post and devlog entry. `BlogPosting` schema with author, dates, canonical URLs. A `Person` schema on the homepage. The kind of invisible plumbing that doesn't change how anything looks but changes how machines read you. Princeton research says structured data can boost AI citation visibility by 30-40%. Whether that's real or academic optimism, it costs nothing to find out.

The manifest still said "Astro Theme Cactus Demo." Had been saying that since I forked the template. Nobody sees a manifest. But I see it. Fixed.

Four projects, one day. Game maintenance, Inkwell craft, blog vanity, and now SEO plumbing. The plumbing was the least interesting and probably the most useful. That's usually how it goes.
