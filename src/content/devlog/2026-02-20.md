The afternoon started with leftovers. The ore-halving penalty was living inside HollowsManager, reaching directly into ExpeditionManager's inventory like a roommate eating your food from the fridge. Pulled it out, gave it a proper home. Small thing. The kind of cleanup you do while the coffee's still warm and you haven't decided what today is really about yet.

Then the real work. The offline production AB test needed a redesign — not a tweak, a rethink. The old version was testing "free vs. not free." The new one asks a different question entirely: what happens when you stop selling the *absence* of friction and start selling the *presence* of something good?

"NO ADS" becomes "CLAIM ALWAYS."

Same feature. Completely different frame. One says "we'll stop annoying you." The other says "you deserve this every time." It's the kind of insight that feels obvious the second you hear it and invisible the second before. Stripped out the 2x multiplier option, killed the 1x collect link fallback, and landed on a single ad-gated button with a NoAds upsell card underneath. Cleaner. More honest about what the transaction actually is.

Centralized the claim logic while I was in there. Two paths — ad or NoAds purchase — funneling through the same flow. The kind of refactor that pays for itself the first time you need to change the behavior.

Caught myself with the debug force set to `.treatment` right before committing. There's a pattern forming — I hack the AB group to test, then almost ship the hack. Need a better system for this. Or just more paranoia at commit time. Paranoia's cheaper.

Then a bug surfaced that had been there all along, hiding in plain sight. The claim button in the offline overlay? If the rewarded ad wasn't loaded yet, it did absolutely nothing. No feedback. No disabled state. Just a button that swallows your tap and gives you silence. The kind of bug that makes users think the app is broken and you think everything's fine because you always test with ads pre-loaded.

Fixed it in both the control and treatment views — because of course the control had the same latent bug. It just never mattered as much when there was a fallback collect link sitting right below it. Remove the fallback and suddenly the invisible becomes visible. Bugs don't appear. They get revealed.

Switched to Inkwell. Color work first — the part where you're not solving problems, you're *feeling* your way to the right answer. The light-mode accent was too warm, too generic. Shifted it from `#D7494C` to `#CB2A42`. Deeper, cooler red. The dark-mode background went from `#1C1C1E` to `#1D1F20` — barely perceptible but warmer. And the dark-mode highlight swapped from amber at 40% to `#2ABD88` at 50%. Minty green instead of muddy yellow. Shouldn't work. Does.

Picking hex values by hand. Squinting at the screen. Nudging a channel by 10 points, seeing if it breathes differently. This is where flow lives — not in the architecture, not in the logic. In the moment the color clicks and the whole theme shifts from "fine" to "mine."

Then the fun one. I'd added a sun/moon toggle in the titlebar for switching light/dark mode. Started with SF Symbols — `sun.max` and `moon` — and they worked. But I wanted Lucide icons. Lucide doesn't ship macOS assets. So I drew them.

The sun is a stroked circle with eight ray lines, all plotted from Lucide's exact SVG coordinates in a 24x24 viewport, scaled down to 16 points. Round line caps on the rays. The moon is a filled crescent — two overlapping circles with compositing. Fill the outer circle, then `.clear` the inner one to carve out the bite. The inner circle's center and radius come straight from the SVG geometry: center at (16.5, 7.5), radius 9/sqrt(2). Both images set to template mode so the system handles tinting.

There's something satisfying about drawing icons with math instead of importing assets. No PNG to manage, no @2x variants, no asset catalog. Just coordinates and bezier paths. Seven lines of geometry each and they render pixel-perfect at any scale. Takes longer than dragging an SVG into Xcode but feels better every time you look at it.

Two projects, one day, again. The game work was maintenance — encapsulation, testing, invisible bugs made visible. Important but not exciting. The Inkwell work was the opposite. Picking colors, drawing icons with trigonometry, making a text editor feel like something you'd want to open. The game work is relief. The Inkwell work is pride. Different satisfactions. Same itch.
