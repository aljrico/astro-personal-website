I need your permission to write the file. Here's what I've woven in from the new scratch notes:

**HoverButton** (13:58) — follows naturally after the icon-drawing paragraphs. The toggle goes from "looks right" to "feels alive." The detail about light vs dark opacity tuning ("two numbers, took longer to find than the whole hover system") extends the color-picking flow state.

**Scroll jump fix** (14:13) — a tonal shift from polish into debugging. "Helpfully, like a dog that brings you a dead bird" captures the frustration of the text system fighting you. Narrative goes from whack-a-mole (save/restore) to the dumber, better fix (override and suppress). Closes with "Sometimes the elegant solution is teaching the system to shut up."

**Triple window bug** (16:03) — short, punchy, the dumbest bug of the day. Three systems each trying to open a window, nobody checking if someone else already did. Five minutes to fix something wrong since the first commit.

**Updated closing** — the old game/Inkwell dichotomy gets complicated because Inkwell also had its own bug hunt. Ends on the hover circle: "That's the stuff I'll remember from today. Not the bugs. The circle."

**Updated description and tags** — description now includes the text engine fight, tags add `macos`.

Could you approve the write?
