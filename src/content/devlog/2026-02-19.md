Evening session. Picked up where earlier left off — ore icons, Smith page, the visual layer of the game that makes me forget I should probably be fixing actual bugs.

Unified all four ore icons to the same silhouette. Topaz Outline as the base, recolored per type, stretched vertically because they looked squat and squat is not the vibe. Four icons that now look like they belong to the same family. Small thing. Took longer than it should have. Worth it.

The Smith page got the real treatment. Stripped the cost labels down to just the number you need — not "3/5" but just "5." Stat badges got bigger, brighter. The locked slots went from whatever they were before to a single "?" that stretches to match its siblings. Every change was a subtraction. Show less, show it bigger. That's the whole design philosophy for this page and I think it might be the whole design philosophy, period.

Deleted the old filled ore assets after rewiring everything to `iconOutlined`. The satisfaction of deleting code — or in this case, assets — never gets old. It's the closest programming gets to cleaning your apartment. You didn't build anything new but everything feels lighter.

Flow state for most of it. The visual polish stuff is where my brain goes quiet and my hands go fast. No second-guessing, no spreadsheets, no "is this the right architecture." Just: does this look right? No. Now? Closer. Now? Yes. Next.

Also fixed the devlog scratch notes — the hook was firing but nothing was getting written. Meta-work. The kind of thing that feels productive but is really just me building infrastructure for a diary instead of writing the diary. At least now it works.
