Started the evening by discovering the devlog scratch notes weren't actually being captured. The hook was firing. Claude just wasn't writing anything. The diary about building things — itself not being built. There's a metaphor in there somewhere but I'm too tired to chase it.

Fixed it. Moving on.

The real work today was icons and the Smith page. Had four ore types, each with their own filled icon style. Looked fine individually. Looked like four different artists when you put them side by side. So I killed the variety — unified everything to the Topaz Outline silhouette, just recolored per ore type. Then stretched them vertically because they were squat little things, wider than they were tall, and that bugged me every time I looked at the grid.

Deleted the old filled assets after. Pointed `OreType.icon` to `iconOutlined` and that was that. Four files gone, zero functionality lost. The best commits are the ones where you subtract.

The Smith page got the same treatment. Cost labels were showing "owned/needed" — too much information for a glance. Now they just show what you need. Stat badges got bigger, brighter. The locked equipment slots were these elaborate placeholder cards. Replaced them with a single "?" that stretches to match its siblings. Cleaner. Calmer.

Show less. Show it bigger. That's the whole philosophy and it keeps being right.

Hit flow on the UI pass. That thing where you're not thinking about code anymore, you're just seeing shapes and spacing and color, and your hands are translating directly from the picture in your head. No friction. The particle system high from a different project, different day — same frequency. The screen doing what you imagined it would do.

It's always the visual stuff. Never the architecture, never the data model. Give me a layout that clicks into place and I'll ride that for hours.
