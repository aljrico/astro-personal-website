Started the evening picking up a compacted session. Context gone, but the work was still warm from earlier — ore icons, Smith page, the visual stuff that pulls me in like gravity.

The icons were bugging me. Four ore types, four different silhouettes, four slightly different visual languages pretending to be a family. Took the Topaz outline — the one that actually looked good — and made the others conform. Same silhouette, different colors. Then stretched them vertically because they were squatting there like little pancakes. Now they breathe.

The Smith page got a diet. Cost labels were showing "3/5" when all I needed was "5." The player knows what they have. Stat badges were too small, too muted — pumped them up, let them be loud. And the locked slots — three separate "?" icons doing the same nothing — collapsed into one that stretches to fill the space. Less noise, more signal.

Deleted the old filled ore assets after rewiring everything to the outlines. The kind of cleanup that feels like losing weight. Code gets lighter, the asset folder stops lying about what's actually used.

The whole session was flow. Pure visual polish, the kind where you squint at padding values and nudge things two points left and suddenly it *clicks*. "Show less, show it bigger." That's the whole design philosophy for this page and maybe for the whole game. Every time I remove something, what's left gets stronger.

Also discovered the devlog system was broken. The hook was firing, dutifully, into the void. Notes weren't being written. Fixed it. There's something poetic about a journaling system that silently fails to journal. How long was it broken? Don't want to know.
