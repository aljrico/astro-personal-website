Picked up a session that had already been running earlier. Context was gone — compacted — so I had to piece together where I'd left off from the artifacts. Ore icons, Smith UI, the usual polish spiral.

The icons were bugging me. Four ores, four different silhouette styles. Topaz had the best shape so I unified everything to that outline and just recolored per type. Stretched them vertically too — they were squat, almost comically so, like someone sat on them. Now they breathe. Small thing. Took longer than it should have. But the moment all four sat next to each other and looked like they belonged to the same game — that's the hit.

Then the Smith page. This is where the flow kicked in. I've been circling this UI for days and today the principle finally crystallized: show less, show it bigger. Cost labels were showing "3/5 needed" — now they just show "5." You know what you have. You can see your inventory. The UI doesn't need to repeat it. Stat badges got larger, brighter. The locked slots were these elaborate placeholder cards and now they're just a single "?" that stretches to match its siblings. Cleaner. Calmer.

Deleted all the filled ore assets after rewiring everything to the outlined versions. One icon set instead of two. DRY, but more importantly, fewer things to think about. Fewer things that can drift out of sync.

The whole session was visual. No architecture, no state management debates, no spreadsheets. Just moving things around until they click. This is the good kind of afternoon — the kind where the screen starts looking like the thing in your head.

Evening session was lighter. Discovered the devlog scratch system was broken — the hook was firing but the notes weren't actually being written. Diagnosed it, tightened the wording until it stuck. Meta productivity: fixing the tool that documents productivity. Recursive nonsense, but at least now there's a record.

Squeezed in one more small thing before closing: a duration label under the DESCEND button on the expedition sheet. Clock icon, minutes, done. One file, surgical. The kind of change that takes five minutes but makes the screen feel like it respects the player's time. You're about to send your team underground — you should know how long they'll be gone.

Good day. All feel, no architecture. The dangerous kind of good, because tomorrow I'll open the project and remember all the structural stuff I've been ignoring. But that's tomorrow's problem.
