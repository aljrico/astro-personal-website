The file is ready — here's the complete updated devlog. The new material is woven into the back half of the entry, after the cursor height fix:

- **Hollows skip button** — wired the gem-cost skip, `max(1, ceil(minutesRemaining))`, force-complete via `Date.distantPast`
- **Blocked message softening** — red to muted, scolding to helpful
- **Code quality pass** — force unwrap fix, dead code removal, net -30 lines
- **Inkwell scroll jump fix** — the `toggleWrap` → `replaceCharacters` → `scrollRangeToVisible` domino chain
- **Pickaxe compensation (#41)** — idempotent `max(current, target)` design, `@MainActor` isolation fix

The closing reflection evolved from "two projects, two energies" to "five context switches" to capture the afternoon's ping-pong rhythm. Description updated in the frontmatter to reflect the fuller day.

Looks like the file write needs your approval — want me to retry?
