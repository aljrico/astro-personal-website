Built the devlog system today. There's something recursive about it — writing the infrastructure to capture what it feels like to write infrastructure. The whole thing is designed to run in the background, hooks firing on commits, scratch notes piling up, then a separate process stitching them into something readable at the end of the session.

The idea comes from Jordan Mechner's journals. He didn't know which days would matter, so he wrote them all. That's the bet here too. Most days will be nothing. But the nothing days give the something days their weight.

The technical side was straightforward — Astro content collection, a few pages, a layout that's deliberately simpler than the blog. No table of contents, no cover images. Just date, text, done. Like a notebook page.

The interesting part is the hooks. Claude gets a nudge after every commit and before context compaction to jot down scratch notes. Then at session end, a separate process reads those notes plus SOUL.md and generates the entry. Zero context cost to the main session. The diary writes itself while you're not looking.

Venga. Let's see if I'm still doing this in a month.
