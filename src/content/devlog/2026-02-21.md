Ripped out pagefind tonight. The search icon, the component, the packages, the postbuild script, the data attributes sprinkled across layouts. All of it. Gone.

The blog has maybe forty posts. Search was solving a problem that doesn't exist yet and might never exist. Meanwhile it was choking the build pipeline with a darwin-arm64 error I didn't feel like debugging. That's the thing about features you add "just in case" — they rot quietly until the day they break something that matters.

There's a particular satisfaction in deleting a feature. Adding code feels productive but removing code that shouldn't have been there in the first place — that feels *correct*. Like sanding off a bump you've been running your hand over for weeks.

Clean build now. No postbuild step. One less thing between writing and shipping.

Sometimes the best session is the one where you end up with less than you started with.
