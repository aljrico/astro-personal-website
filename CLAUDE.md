# Alejandro's Technical Blog

This is my personal technical blog — a public diary where I document what I'm building, learning, and thinking about.

## What This Is

- A place to share progress on side projects (games, apps, experiments)
- Notes on things I've figured out that might help others
- Honest reflections on what worked and what didn't
- Not polished tutorials — more like "here's what I did and why"

## Writing Style

Inspired by [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com), [Naval](https://nav.al/), and [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html).

**Clarity above all.** Write simply. Remove verbal decoration. If a sentence can be shorter, make it shorter.

**Conversational but sharp.** Accessible language for sophisticated ideas. No jargon. No hedging. Say what you mean.

**Short posts, short paragraphs, short sentences.** White space is good. A post can be a few paragraphs. One idea per post is fine.

**Start with an observation, end with insight.** Begin with something concrete. Build to the point. Don't bury the lead but don't give it all away in the first line either.

**Favor the counterintuitive.** Challenge assumptions. Reframe problems. The interesting ideas are the ones that surprise.

**Concrete over abstract.** Examples over explanations. Show, don't tell. Code snippets when they clarify — minimal, just the interesting part.

**Aphoristic when possible.** Distill ideas to their essence. A good title can be a complete thought.

**Avoid:**
- Corporate speak
- Over-explaining
- Excessive qualifiers ("I think maybe perhaps...")
- Pretending things were easy when they weren't

**Embrace:**
- Admitting confusion
- Half-baked ideas worth sharing
- Links to repos/demos
- Updating old posts when thinking evolves

## Tech Stack
